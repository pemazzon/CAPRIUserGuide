Using Singularity
-----------------

.. _whatsingularity:

Singularity is a *container* technology. It allows the user to create a
container (just like `Docker <https://docker.com>`_ ones) where all the
needed software can be autonomously managed. By *software* we mean that
almost everithing, from the operative system up, can be customized and
run regardless the hosting OS.

Why singularity?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Singularity can run your choice of operative system;
  * Singularity can import your Docker images without superuser privileges 
    and without Docker installed;
  * Singularity is a good way to share your code;
  * Configure on your personal PC; run in the CAPRI environment.
